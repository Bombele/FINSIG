# SUB_MODULE_GUIDE – MODULE_RESEARCH/sciences/

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The `sciences/` sub-module is the **scientific research chamber** of FINSIG.  
It focuses on documenting, structuring, and integrating multidisciplinary scientific knowledge (physics, biology, social sciences, data sciences) into institutional governance and compliance frameworks.

---

## 📑 Scope
- **Scientific foundations**: principles and methodologies from multiple disciplines.  
- **Applied research**: integration of scientific knowledge into compliance, scoring, and institutional adoption.  
- **Documentation**: trilingual guides to ensure accessibility and knowledge transfer.  
- **Innovation**: exploration of emerging scientific paradigms relevant to FINSIG.  
- **Institutional adoption**: preparing frameworks for regulators and partners to understand scientific contributions.
