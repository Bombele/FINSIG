# SUB_MODULE_GUIDE – MODULE_RESEARCH/simulation/

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The `simulation/` sub-module is the **simulation research chamber** of FINSIG.  
It focuses on modeling, testing, and validating institutional, financial, and technical scenarios through controlled simulations.  
Its role is to provide foresight, risk analysis, and compliance validation using reproducible models.

---

## 📑 Scope
- **Scenario modeling**: design of simulations for financial scoring, compliance, and governance.  
- **Risk analysis**: evaluation of institutional, technical, and regulatory risks through simulated environments.  
- **Validation**: testing workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and compliance frameworks under controlled conditions.  
- **Documentation**: trilingual guides to ensure accessibility and reproducibility.  
- **Institutional adoption**: providing simulation frameworks for regulators, banks, and partners.

---

## 📂 Organization
- `SUB_MODULE_GUIDE_EN.md` → Charter of the simulation sub-module.  
- Complementary files may include:  
  - `SIMULATION_FRAMEWORK.md` → Principles and architecture of simulation models.  
  - `EXPERIMENTS_SIMULATION.md` → Documentation of simulation prototypes and experiments.  
  - `COMPLIANCE_SIMULATION.md` → Mapping of simulation outputs to regulatory frameworks.

---

## ⚙️ Functioning
- The sub-module acts as a **laboratory of scenarios** within FINSIG.  
- It ensures that simulations are documented, auditable, and aligned with institutional standards.  
- It provides **strategic foresight** for anticipating risks and validating compliance.  
- It connects with other modules (AI, quantum, sciences, compliance) to ensure interoperability.

---

## ✅ Institutional Impact
- **Reliability**: strengthens institutional trust through reproducible simulations.  
- **Transparency**: clear documentation of simulation methodologies.  
- **Compliance**: alignment of simulation outputs with regulatory standards.  
- **Adoption**: facilitates institutional and continental acceptance of simulation-driven governance.
