# SUB_MODULE_GUIDE – infra_technical/api/

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The `api/` sub-module is the **API chamber** of the infra-technical module in FINSIG.  
It defines the principles, standards, and practices for building, documenting, and maintaining institutional APIs, ensuring interoperability, compliance, and scalability.

---

## 📑 Scope
- **API design**: principles for REST, GraphQL, and other architectures.  
- **Documentation**: trilingual guides to ensure accessibility and reproducibility.  
- **Compliance mapping**: alignment of APIs with institutional and regulatory frameworks.  
- **Integration**: interoperability between infra-technical components and other modules (core, governance, compliance, AI).  
- **Institutional adoption**: providing validated APIs for regulators, banks, and partners.

---

## 📂 Organization
- `SUB_MODULE_GUIDE_EN.md` → Charter of the API sub-module.  
- Complementary files may include:  
  - `API_FRAMEWORK.md` → Principles and architecture of API design.  
  - `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` → Documentation of API interoperability.  
  - `COMPLIANCE_API.md` → Mapping of APIs to compliance standards.

---

## ⚙️ Functioning
- The sub-module acts as the **constitution of API management** within FINSIG.  
- It ensures that APIs are documented, auditable, and aligned with institutional standards.  
- It provides **strategic foresight** for scaling and securing API ecosystems.  
- It connects with other infra-technical and core modules to guarantee interoperability.

---

## ✅ Institutional Impact
- **Reliability**: strengthens institutional trust through robust APIs.  
- **Transparency**: clear documentation of API practices.  
- **Compliance**: alignment with international and local standards.  
- **Adoption**: facilitates institutional and continental acceptance of FINSIG’s API frameworks.
