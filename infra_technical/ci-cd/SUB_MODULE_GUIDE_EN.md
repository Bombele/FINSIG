# SUB_MODULE_GUIDE – infra_technical/ci-cd/

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The `ci-cd/` sub-module is the **continuous integration and deployment chamber** of the infra-technical module in FINSIG.  
It defines the principles, standards, and practices for automating builds, tests, and deployments, ensuring reliability, compliance, and institutional scalability.

---

## 📑 Scope
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: automated builds, testing, and validation of code changes.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: automated delivery of validated artefacts to production environments.  
- **Compliance pipelines**: ensuring regulatory and institutional standards are embedded in CI/CD workflows.  
- **Documentation**: trilingual guides to ensure accessibility and reproducibility.  
- **Institutional adoption**: providing validated CI/CD frameworks for regulators, banks, and partners.

## 📂 Organization
- `SUB_MODULE_GUIDE_EN.md` → Charter of the CI/CD sub-module.  
- Complementary files may include:  
  - `PIPELINE_FRAMEWORK.md` → Principles and architecture of CI/CD pipelines.  
  - `AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md` → Documentation of automation practices.  
  - `COMPLIANCE_PIPELINES.md` → Mapping of CI/CD workflows to compliance standards.
