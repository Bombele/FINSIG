# SUB_MODULE_GUIDE – core/architecture/

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The `architecture/` sub-module is the **institutional architecture chamber** of FINSIG.  
It defines the structural backbone of the system, ensuring modularity, scalability, and compliance with institutional standards.

---

## 📑 Scope
- **System design**: principles and models for modular and scalable architecture.  
- **Documentation**: trilingual guides to ensure accessibility and reproducibility.  
- **Compliance mapping**: alignment of architecture with regulatory and institutional frameworks.  
- **Integration**: interoperability between core modules (governance, compliance, AI, research).  
- **Institutional adoption**: providing architectural frameworks for regulators, banks, and partners.

---

## 📂 Organization
- `SUB_MODULE_GUIDE_EN.md` → Charter of the architecture sub-module.  
- Complementary files may include:  
  - `ARCHITECTURE_FRAMEWORK.md` → Principles and structural models.  
  - `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` → Documentation of interoperability between modules.  
  - `COMPLIANCE_ARCHITECTURE.md` → Mapping of architecture to compliance standards.

---

## ⚙️ Functioning
- The sub-module acts as the **constitution of system design** within FINSIG.  
- It ensures that architecture is documented, auditable, and aligned with institutional standards.  
- It provides **strategic foresight** for scaling and integrating modules.  
- It connects with other core components to guarantee consistency and resilience.

---

## ✅ Institutional Impact
- **Credibility**: strengthens institutional trust through robust architecture.  
- **Transparency**: clear documentation of system design.  
- **Compliance**: alignment with international and local standards.  
- **Adoption**: facilitates institutional and continental acceptance of FINSIG’s architecture.

## 📌 Conclusion
The `architecture/` sub-module is the **structural backbone** of FINSIG’s core.  
It ensures responsible design and integration, reinforcing institutional credibility and continental adoption.
