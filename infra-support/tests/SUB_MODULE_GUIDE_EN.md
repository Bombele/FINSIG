# SUB_MODULE_GUIDE – infra-support/tests/

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The `tests/` sub-module is the **testing chamber** of the infra-support module in FINSIG.  
It defines the principles, standards, and practices for validating infrastructure support, ensuring reliability, compliance, and institutional trust.

---

## 📑 Scope
- **Unit tests**: validation of individual infrastructure components.  
- **Integration tests**: ensuring interoperability between infra-support modules.  
- **Compliance tests**: verifying alignment with regulatory and institutional standards.  
- **Automation**: CI/CD pipelines for reproducible and auditable testing.  
- **Documentation**: trilingual guides to ensure accessibility and reproducibility.

---

## 📂 Organization
- `SUB_MODULE_GUIDE_EN.md` → Charter of the tests sub-module.  
- Complementary files may include:  
  - `UNIT_TESTS.md` → Documentation of unit testing practices.  
  - `INTEGRATION_TESTS.md` → Records of integration testing.  
  - `COMPLIANCE_TESTS.md` → Mapping of tests to compliance standards.

---

## ⚙️ Functioning
- The sub-module acts as the **constitution of infrastructure validation** within FINSIG.  
- It ensures that all infra-support components are tested, documented, and auditable.  
- It provides **strategic foresight** for scaling and securing infrastructure.  
- It connects with other infra-config and core modules to guarantee interoperability.
