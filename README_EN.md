# FINSIG – Regulated Infrastructure for Finance & Insurance

## 🌍 Vision
FINSIG is an **institutional and modular infrastructure** providing scoring and financial transfer solutions tailored to emerging markets.  
Our mission: **reduce risk, build trust, and accelerate financial inclusion** across Africa and Latin America.

## 🧩 Key Modules
- **Credit Scoring**: evaluates banked and unbanked profiles using alternative data (mobile money, bills, community history).  
- **Insurance Scoring**: enables insurers to price premiums accurately (health, agriculture, transport).  
- **Blockchain Transfers**: regulated solution for international transfers, even under sanctions (e.g., Venezuela).  
- **Compliance & Governance**: integrated framework (ISO/IEC, BCC, GDPR), with journaling (`BITACORA.md`) and CI/CD workflows for auditability.

## 📊 Use Cases
- **DRC**: financial inclusion of unbanked populations through credit and insurance scoring.  
- **Venezuela**: international money transfers and alternative scoring for banks and fintechs.  
- **Continental expansion**: progressive adoption across Africa and Latin America.

## 🚀 Differentiation
