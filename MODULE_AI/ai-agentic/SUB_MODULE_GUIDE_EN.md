# SOUS-MODULE_GUIDE – MODULE_AI/ai-agentic/

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The `ai-agentic/` sub-module is the **autonomy and agentic intelligence chamber** of the AI module in FINSIG.  
It defines the principles, architecture, and safeguards for building agentic AI systems capable of autonomous decision-making while remaining aligned with institutional and ethical standards.

---

## 📑 Scope
- **Agentic intelligence**: design of autonomous agents that can act, learn, and adapt.  
- **Governance**: ensuring agentic systems respect compliance, transparency, and accountability.  
- **Integration**: connecting agentic AI with other modules (compliance, governance, reports).  
- **Risk management**: preventing misuse, bias, or harmful autonomous behaviors.  
- **Documentation**: trilingual guides for accessibility and institutional adoption.
