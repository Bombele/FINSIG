# MODULE_GUIDE – docs/

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The `docs/` module is the **executive documentation chamber** of FINSIG.  
It gathers institutional guides, technical syntheses, and trilingual indexes, providing clear navigation and coherent governance.  
It does not replace the guides of technical sub-modules (located in `core/`, `audit/`, `data/`, etc.), but offers a **strategic overview**.

---

## 📑 Scope
- **Executive documentation**: global view of the project and institutional pitch.  
- **Trilingual index**: detailed navigation in FR/EN/ES.  
- **CI/CD and quality guides**: validation standards and continuous integration.  
- **Development guides**: best practices and deployment.  
- **Specific modules**: presentation of technical components (e.g., AI).  
- **Traceability**: central BITÁCORA in `docs/`, replicated in each module.

## ⚙️ Functioning
- The `docs/` module is the **documentation entry point** for partners, regulators, and developers.  
- Subfolders structure the documentation: governance, CI/CD, development, modules.  
- BITÁCORA is placed directly in `docs/` as the **central journal**, then replicated in each module for local traceability.  
- Technical sub-module guides remain in their respective folders to preserve modularity.

## ✅ Institutional impact
- **Clarity**: structured and trilingual documentation navigation.  
- **Traceability**: centralized and distributed journaling.  
- **Transmission**: onboarding facilitated for all profiles.  
- **Adoption**: strengthened credibility with institutions thanks to clear executive documentation.

## 📌 Conclusion
The `docs/` module is the **executive library** of FINSIG.  
It connects strategic guides, indexes, technical standards, and institutional syntheses.  
Its modular and trilingual structure embodies the constitutional vision of the project.
